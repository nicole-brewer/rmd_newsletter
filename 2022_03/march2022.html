<p>This year’s conference will include a panel discussion and workshop
on data ethics and highlight <strong>the role data ethics plays in good
data stewardship and avoiding harm</strong>. Additionally, there will be
a <strong>workshop on “Data Ethics practices with machine learning and
AI,”</strong> which will explore data ethics considerations in the real
world, tools available to mitigate the risk from data bias, and a
demonstration of a bias in a dataset.</p>

<p>Have you used advanced computing resources to do your research? Have
you ever felt that the technical details require just as much attention
as the science? Look no further than the <strong>Practice and Experience
in Advanced Research Computing Conference</strong> (PEARC22) that will
convene <strong>July 10–14, 2021, in Boston, Massachusetts</strong>.
Short papers and poster are due <a href="https://pearc.acm.org/pearc22/call-for-participation/">April 8,
2020</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://pearc.acm.org/pearc22/call-for-participation/pearc22-sp/">Student
Program</a> (SP) highlights include an orientation day, a resumé clinic,
mentor-protege pairing, an exhibitor Q&amp;A, and a new tabling event
called “The Village!” It’s <strong>five full days of professional
development</strong> designed to help scholars envision themselves
<strong>working in research computing and data science</strong> (RCD)
careers within academia, industry, and government agencies. Apply
today!</p>

<h3>Funding</h3>
<p>Student Volunteers receive an all-access pass to the full conference,
including tutorials. If you do not receive additional funds through the
conference, we will fund remaining travel expenses. If you are
considering applying, please <a href="mailto:brewer36@purdue.edu">email
us</a> so we can help you with your submission and get you connected
with those of us in research computing who attend the conference.</p>

<h2>[Training] SDSC GPU Hackathon</h2>
<div id="apply-by-march-13-2022" class="section level3">

by March 13, 2022</a></h3>
<p>The San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) in partnership with NVIDIA
and Oak Ridge National Lab is hosting a GPU Hackathon. The Hackathon is
a multi-day, intensive hands-on event, <strong>designed to help
computational scientists and researchers port, optimize, and accelerate
their applications using GPUs</strong>. These events pair participants
with dedicated mentors experienced in GPU programming and development.
Representing distinguished scholars and preeminent institutions from
around the world, the teams of mentors and attendees work together to
realize performance gains and speedups by taking advantage of parallel
programming on GPUs. Participating teams can expect to either have their
applications running on GPUs, or a clear roadmap of next steps to
leverage GPUs.</p>
<p>A 2021 Experience:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>“The virtual GPU Hackathon was an extremely useful experience. With
the help of our mentors, we were able to identify key parts of our code
for recoding and GPU offloading. The Hackathon was the push we needed to
start optimizing our code to run efficiently on GPU nodes, and access to
the Nvidia GPU A100 nodes was especially helpful. Today, 9 months after
the Hackathon, we have a super-fast, fully operational GPU code.”</dt>
